# solar-react  ☀️

## Description:
Our app provides a calculator to determine applicability of solar power to an address based on latitude, longitude, KWH usage per day and DNI irradiance calculations.  

## User Story
As a user interested in solar power for environmental or monetary savings - I would like to find out if my if home or business is suitable for solar installation.  I need an easy way to calculate whether its worth my time or not.

## Usage

The user enters an address and monthly electric bill information and the app calculates a necessary system size which is then evaluated based on size thresholds to determine if their site is suitable for solay system installation.

## Potential Questions: 
Do you have tree coverage, how old is your roof?  then if its a good score refer them to local solar panel installation and then if a low score we can refer them to local comunity solar or other alternative power resources.

Provide a state wide calculation could eventually also provide quotes.   General information on solar
